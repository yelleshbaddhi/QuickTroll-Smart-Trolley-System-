   ```cpp
   std::vector<Product> products = {
     {"F3A57B11", "Rice", 10.00, "https://i.imgur.com/CZ98GeU.jpg"},
     {"24550D04", "Oil", 20.00, "https://i.imgur.com/ijfSykj.jpg"},
   };
   ```

2. Change Payment Gateway:
   - Replace the Razorpay key in the pay_now() function.


## Troubleshooting

- RFID Not Working: Check wiring and power supply.
